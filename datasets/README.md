- Include a simple data dictionary when possible

## Recommended fields for analytics demos
- Date or timestamp
- Metric values (revenue, orders, sessions, conversion rate, costs)
- Dimensions for drilldowns (channel, region, product, cohort)
- Location fields for maps (country, region, city, lat, long)
